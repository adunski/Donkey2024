# Odometry

Odometry is way to calculate the speed and distance travelled of the car by measuring the rotation of its wheels using a sensor called an rotary encoder. This encoder can be on the motor, on the main drive shaft or on individual wheels. 

Encoders come in various forms:
* Quadrature encoders use hall-effect sensors to measure magnetic pulses as the shaft turns, and have the advantage of being very precise as well as being able to tell the difference between forward and reverse rotation
* Single-output encoders are like quadrature encoders but they can not determine the direction of motion
* Optical encoders are typicall a LED/Light sensor combo with a disk that has slots cut in in-between them. As the disk rotates, the light is interruprted and those pulses are counted. These sensors are cheap and easy to install but cannot determine the direction of rotation

There are several ways to read encoders with Donkey:
* Directly with the RaspberryPi's GPIO pins. This is best for optical encoders, since they don't generate as many pulses as a quadrature encoder and the RPi will miss fewer of them as it task-swaps between the various Donkeycar parts
* With an Arduino or Teensy. This is best for quadrature encoders, since the Arduino/Teensy is 100% devoted to counting pulses. It transmits the count to the RPi via the USB serial port when requested by Donkeycar, which lightens the processing load for the Rpi
* With an Astar board. This is just a fancy Arduino, but if you have one, it makes for a neat installation


## Supported Encoders

Examples of rotary encoders that are supported:

* Quadrature encoders. [Larger, cheaper](https://amzn.to/3liBUjj), [Smaller, more expensive](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10932)
* Optical encoder sensors and discs [Available from many sources on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Q6BOjk)

## Hardware Setup

How you attach your encoder is up to you. [Here's](https://diyrobocars.com/2020/01/31/how-to-add-an-encoder-to-the-donkeycar-chassis/) one way to put a quadrature encoder on the main drive shaft. [Here](https://guitar.ucsd.edu/maeece148/index.php/Project_encoders) is a more complex setup with dual encoders. 

If you are using the RPi GPIO pins, connect the encoder sensors GND, V+ (which might say 5V or 3.3V) and data pin (which will say "Out or "D0". If your encoder has four pins, ignore the one that says "A0") to the RPi 5V, Ground and GPIO 13 as shown here:

## Software Setup

Enable odometry in `myconfig.py`.

```HAVE_ODOM = True                   # Do you have an odometer/encoder 
ENCODER_TYPE = 'Arduino'            # What kind of encoder? GPIO|Arduino|Astar 
MM_PER_TICK = 12.7625               # How much travel with a single tick, in mm. Roll you car a meter and divide total ticks measured by 1,000
ODOM_PIN = 4                        # if using GPIO, which GPIO board mode pin to use as input
ODOM_DEBUG = False                  # Write out values on vel and distance as it runs
```

If you are using an Arduino or Teensy to read your encoder, the microcontroller should be flashed using the Arduino IDE with [this sketch](https://github.com/zlite/donkeycar/tree/master/donkeycar/parts/encoder/encoder). Make sure you check the sketch using the "test_encoder.py code in the Donkeycar tests folder to make sure you've got your encoder plugged into the right pins, or edit it to reflect the pins you are using.
